# Library-Management-System

This project revolves around the development of an ISBN barcode scanner application tailored for a second-hand bookstore's library management system. 
The primary goal was to enhance the efficiency of book cataloguing and retrieval, enabling seamless integration with the existing operational framework. 
The application is built using HTML and JavaScript, employing the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader library and OpenLibrary's API to retrieve real-time book details.
Requires Dynamsoft Barcode Reader/SDK License to use the scanner, but ISBNs can be manually added as well.
